Step 1
>git --version
>exit

Step 2
>Login to Git Hub
>create new reposioty and select Initilize this repository with a README

Step 3
>git config --global user.name "Karthik"
>git config --global user.email "karthiklingasamy@gmail.com"

Step 4: To check your git config is correct
>git config --global --list

Step 5:Clone Remote Repository
Note: Go to /c/Karthik/PythonUtility and run the below command
>git clone https://github.com/karthiklingasamy/jmeter-ScenarioGenerator.git

Step 6: To get the status of the repository
>cd jmeter-ScenarioGenerator
>ls
>git status

On branch main--->Default branch by convention
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. ---->The git clone command automatically set up the relationship with the remore reposatiory and name it as 'origin/main'

nothing to commit, working tree clean


Step 6: Create one text file/python file/python
>echo "Test Git Quick Start demo" >>start.txt
>git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:  ----->means it a file in our working directory that has not been added to git yet
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        start.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Step 7: To add the file to the git
>git add start.txt
>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   start.txt
	
Step 8: To commit (After commit the file is moved from staging to local repository)
>git commit -m "My first Commit"


Step 10: To see the status now
>git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Step 11: To Push
>git push origin main

Step 12: To make sure we are upto date. The best practice always do pull before push. So my repository is upt data with remote remote repo
>git pull origin main


Step 12: Shortcut the add & commit process into one step
>git commit -am "First Commit"
Note: It will commit only the tracked file and ignore the untracked files

How to find Tracked files
What is tracked file?
create new temp file in your working directory
git is aware of any file already commited into repo or any file already into index or git staging area
>git ls-files
>git status (You will see untracked file)
